Hi, my name is Minsu Ko, a senior undergraduate student at the department of physics at Korea Advanced Institute of Science
and Technology (KAIST). Currently I'm working as a student assistant at the Center for Axion and Precision Physics
Research (CAPP) of Institute for Basic Science (IBS).

This is my small blog. Here I provide the details about me in [About (CV)], my publications at [Publications].
Especially in [Studies] I share my documentized notes on studying physics. 

You can contact me via komin0310@kaist.ac.kr
