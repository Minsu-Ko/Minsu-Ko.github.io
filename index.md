Hi, my name is Minsu Ko, a senior undergraduate student at the department of physics at Korea Advanced Institute of Science
and Technology (KAIST). Currently I'm working as a student assistant at the Center for Axion and Precision Physics
Research (CAPP) of Institute for Basic Science (IBS).

**My interest lies on**
- Fundamental particle physics related to the creation and evolution of the universe.
- Explain the huge scale cosmology based on the observational particle physics, founded by [Koshiba].
- Cutting-edge sensitivity detectors for beyond standard model physics.

**This is my small blog.**
- [About me (CV)] : You can get details about me and see (or download) my CV.
- [Publications] : I listed my publications (paper, presentation, etc) here.
- [Studies] : I share my documentized notes on studying physics.

You can contact me via [email](komin0310@kaist.ac.kr)
